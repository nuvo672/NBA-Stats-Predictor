# NBA-Stats-Predictor


This Python code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application for predicting NBA player points in upcoming games. It uses libraries like Tkinter for the GUI, BeautifulSoup and Selenium for web scraping player data, and scikit-learn for machine learning predictions. 

Users can input a player's name and a points threshold, and the application scrapes recent performance data to make predictions. It also allows users to configure settings for paths and directories, and displays a history of previous predictions in a separate tab.

## Run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/nuvo672/NBA-Stats-Predictor.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
python NBAPointsPredictor.py
```

## 

### Specify Paths in Settings Tab
